# About Me
Welcome to matthewslopecki/Me! A repository created to provide some information about myself and some samples of my work. Feel free to contact me at [this email address](mailto:matthew.slopecki@mail.mcgill.ca)!
The purpose of this GIT is a repository to provide some information on me. For example I will populate this location with some sample code and my CV among other things.
